BUILDING NOTES
=====================================================================

You need: JDK 7, Maven 3.2, Protocol buffers (protoc) 2.6.1.
Building is supported from the command line with Maven and
from any IDE that can load Maven projects (on Eclipse, use m2e).
Some operating systems have some of all of these tools preinstalled,
but the check the versions: any older releases will NOT work.

Building via Maven will NOT work with JDK 8, because the projects
use error-prone which is not yet JDK 8-compatible.  You can work
around this by defining the property m2e.version to any value
(error-prone doesn't play well with m2e either, and we cannot use
a proper profile rule for <jdk>!1.8</jdk> because, you guessed,
this also breaks m2e). JDK 8 support is coming soon for error-prone
so this hack for non-Eclipse builds should be temporary.
