# Sample Extended Startup script. If this script exists in /bin, it will be invoked after
# the core bootstrapping script. This script cannot fail if it was already executed before
# (actions should be incremental, or idempotent, or skipped if already performed),
# as the entire bootstrapping is re-executed on reboots or even periodically.
